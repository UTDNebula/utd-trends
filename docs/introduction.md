## Welcome to the UTD Trends Component Documentation

This is the front end documentation for the UTD Trends repository, here you can find all
the documentation we have provided on each of our in house components along with examples
of how to implement them inside the UTD Trends code base.

## Sections

You will see that our documentation is broken up into a couple of sections. Each section
represents a discrete set of components that are relevant to a specific type of development.
This should help you find what you are looking for quickly while learning about our component
library.
